								<b>Characterising Transiting Exoplanets with TESS and NGTS</b>
								<br> 
								The main bulk of my project work involves using a combination of transit photometry data and radial velocity data from
								both space and ground-based telescopes. The joint modelling
								that we perform using python code allows us to bring together a wealth of data from various sources, take into account
								stellar activity using Gaussian Process (GP) modelling, and ultimately generate the fundamental parameters of exoplanet systems in order
								to fully characterise them.
								<br>
							</p>
							
							<p>
								I am a member of the TESS Follow-Up Observing Program (<a href="https://tess.mit.edu/followup/">TFOP</a>), the monotransits working group of <a href="https://ngtransits.org/">NGTS</a>, and the Astronomers for Planet Earth 
								initiative (<a href="https://astronomersforplanet.earth/">Astro4Earth</a>).
								<br>
								I also have experience observing with ESO's <a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/instruments/harps.html">HARPS</a> spectrograph at La Silla Observatory, Chile, scheduling observations of stellar spectra for 
								radial velocity data on behalf of fellow exoplanet researchers.
								<br>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>MPhys Physics with Astrophysics - University of Kent <i>(2015-2019)</i></b>
								<br> 
								My MPhys dissertation, entitled 'Understanding Massive Star Formation', discussed the proposal and testing of a stage-based model of massive star 
							 	formation using IDL code, with particular focus on bolometric temperature evolution and the Lyman excess problem. I also completed a 
								dissertation during my undergraduate study entitled 'An Assessment of Triton as a Target for Studies of Habitability', in which I designed a 
								research project to test new equipment ahead of a mission to Triton, based upon previous habitability research conducted on other icy moons of the Solar system.

							<p>
								<b>TOI-836: a super-Earth and mini-Neptune transiting a nearby K-dwarf</b> - <i>Submitted to MNRAS</i>
								<br> 
								This first project puts into practice the above methods, which we used to examine transit photometry data from the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite">TESS</a> and
								<a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cheops">CHEOPS</a> satellites, and the ground telescopes <a href="https://ngtransits.org/">NGTS</a>, 
								<a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2010/03/aa13629-09/aa13629-09.html">ASTEP</a>, <a href="https://lco.global/">LCO</a> and <a href="https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/MEarth/Telescopes.html">MEarth</a>.
								This data was jointly modelled with spectroscopic radial velocity data from <a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/instruments/harps.html">HARPS</a> and <a href="https://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/crane/pfs/">PFS</a>
								to produce a complete set of characterising values using the <a href="https://docs.exoplanet.codes/en/latest/">exoplanet</a> python package.
								<br>
								TOI-836 b is a super-Earth planet on a 3.82 day orbit, and TOI-836 c is a sub-Neptune planet on an 8.59 day orbit.
								<br>
								TOI-836 c also displays Transit Timing Variations (TTVs), which may indicate the presence of a third planet in the system.
								<br>
								We submitted our discovery paper to MNRAS in March 2022.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<b>Duotransit Candidates from the TESS Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere</b> - <i>In prep</i>
								<br>
								My second project is a wider survey paper, examining and vetting transit lightcurves from Year 1 and Year 3 of the TESS mission after processing with a new pipeline
								to identify exoplanets with only two transit events, filtering out those which are caused by asteroids and eclipsing binaries. These planets are typically on much longer periods,
								and our ultimate goal will be to release our list
								of new planet candidates as 'Community Objects of Interest' (CTOIs) which are amenable to follow-up modelling and characterisation.
								<br>
								We are expecting to submit our paper and list of candidates in mid-2022.

								<b>Teachin:</b>
								I worked as a Senior Graduate Teaching Assistant for the first year undergraduate Mathematics module, PX149, during the first and second years of my PhD studies. My 
								responsibilities included marking and grading weekly assignments and delivering two seminar classes per week.
								<br>
								I also worked independently as a private tutor from October 2019 to June 2021, teaching Mathematics and Physics to GCSE and A-Level, working with students 
								across a wide range of abilities, ages and academic backgrounds.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Outreach</b>
								I am a student committee member for the monthly <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/seminars/equitea/">Equitea</a> meeting, a forum designed to discuss topics related to Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (ED&I) in 
								relation to Astronomy, Physics and STEM. I have co-chaired two of these meetings thus far. In October 2021, I coordinated a fundraising month in aid of <a href="https://www.ocduk.org/">OCD-UK</a>, which raised £530 in total for the charity. I have also taken the university's <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dean-of-students-office/community-values-education/activebystanderintervention/">Active Bystander Intervention Course</a>.
								<br>
								I am also on the Local Organising Committee (LOC) for the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/ceh/">Centre for Exoplanets and Habitability</a> here at Warwick, and I have 
								also been a student ambassador for the wider Physics department, assisting with open days for prospective students.
								<br>
								During my undergraduate study I was the treasurer of the <a href="https://kentunion.co.uk/activities/space">University of Kent Space Society</a>, with my responsibilities being 
								managing society budgets and accounts, and processing a development fund from Kent Union to install wireless internet at the telescope dome. We also hosted an 
								event in May 2016 for the Mercury transit, inviting local college students and astronomy enthusiasts to safely observe the transit using our 12-inch telescope.
